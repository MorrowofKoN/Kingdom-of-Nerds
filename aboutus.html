            We are proud to be the ones to bring Kingdom of Nerds
            to you. We are all just a bunch of weirdos that found a

                Hi everyone! My name is Morrow, and I am just a plain
                out full weirdo. I created Kingdom of Nerds when I was
                only 16, to offer up a home to all the outcasts who like
                me, just didn’t fit in anywhere. So a little about myself:
                I am a fantasy and computer nerd through and through.
                I absolutely love Lord of the Rings, which I consider to
                be the greatest work of literature ever compiled. I have
                Irish blood in me, which I am extremely proud of, and I
                intend to die in Ireland once I grow old. I also tend to
                be quite anti-social, I’m an INTP (look it up if you don’t
                know XD), and I’m also single. So, Live Your Life and till
                the morrow!

                Hello fellow Konians! I’m Warlow and a pretty big nerd about
                a lot of things, especially musicals and the performances of
                Anthony Warlow! Usually, I am pretty introverted, but I tend
                to open up more when I get to know people, especially online.
                Currently, I am a student in university studying information
                and technology. I am honoured to serve as one of your nerdy
                rulers and to spend time nerding out with you all :)

                Hello All. I am Alphros and I am a huge nerd. I like reading some
                specific history or philosophy books or even books on politics and
                debate strategies. I listen A LOT to Hamilton and a little less to
                Beetlejuice as those are the two of my favorite Musicals. I am an
                introvert and a big one, yet I am amazing at projecting my vocals
                and doing speeches. I am a huge History and Politics nerd too.
