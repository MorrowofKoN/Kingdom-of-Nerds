			<h2>A Little About Us</h2>
			<p>
				We are a group of weirdos, nerds, and outcasts that had a grand idea, to do something that seems in reality
				completely pointless. We decided to create a movement for something that one would never even consider.
				There are movements out there for many different groups, all fighting to create a more equal world. 
				Well, we believe in equality for all too, but we decided to focus on another aspect of that. We work with 
				members of many other movements fighting for equality and act as an all around inclusive group focused on creating
				a much more equal societal setting for those considered outcasts in this world.
