        <h2><b>Clan Warfare</b></h2>
        <p>
            To declare war upon another clan, you must offer up a declaration of war to the clan you wish to declare war upon.
            You must however have a valid reason to declare war upon another clan, e.g. they are encroaching upon your clan territory,
            have attacked one of your clan members, or in a case by case, territorial conquest. Territorial conquest declaration of wars
            must be requested from staff and will be reviewed to see whether or not it is an acceptable reason of war.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the case of
            a battle between two clans, both sides will choose a time to conduct the battle on a certain battlefield. The battlefield will
            be chosen by an impartial staff member within the contested area between the two clans. Both sides will be allowed the usage
            of any weapons or equipment they wish, but will not be allowed to leave the battlefield once the battle has begun to restock.
            Supply trains are allowed, one chest bearing mule per 3 clan members. Once the battle has begun you will be allowed to respawn
            into the battle three times, though if you die a fourth time you will be removed from the battle and will effectively be “dead”.
            Which ever side surrenders, retreats, or loses all their players first will be declared the loser, and all clan members that “died”
            will have to give up their inventories to the victorious side. All battles must be overseen by a staff member who will record the outcome
            of said battle for the official records.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the case of a raid or skirmish (no prewarning given) then neither side will
            give up their inventories even if they are on the losing side. However, if a clan is pushed out of their territory then anything
            within that clan’s chests can be taken as loot by the victorious clan. In the case of such a raid or skirmish you may respawn back
            into the battle unlimited times if you so choose to, and will only in effect be limited to the durability of your weapons and armor.
