        <h1><b>Kingdom of Nerds: The Server</b></h1>
        <p>
            KoN didn't start off as a movement of weirdos, it started off as just your regular old discord server.
            In the beginning we weren't very large at all, it was just me and a couple other people that joined the server
            and winded up staying as well. I spent many a hour advertising the place, doing partnerships, spending time on there,
            everything that a server owner should do. It wasn't till several months into the creation of the place that I realized that
            we had something unique going for us here. We had a group of people of all different beliefs, and walks of life coming together
            as one community and I realized that this was something I wanted to spread to the world. We may not be your typical server or
            movement, but we hope to bring the love and sense of community we found online to the rest of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            We've got a lot going for us on the server, and we hope to keep it growing and to introduce new things to make it greater then ever
            so that everyone can feel safe and loved there. I'm going to now share everything we currently have on the server, the ideals that
            we hold dear, and much more!
        </p>

        <h1><b>Server Clubs</b></h1>
        <br />
        <h3><b>Book Club</b></h3>
        <p>
            The KoN book club is a wonderful place to get the opportunity to sit down and read together and discuss books.
            We have biweekly meetings where we all get together in vc and hold a group discussion about the chapters that we read over the
            time since our previous meeting. We also hold different reading competitions, have yearly reading lists, and hold group reads.
        </p>

        <h3><b>Debate Club</b></h3>
        <p>
            Debate club is the perfect place to come and build that logic of yours and to open your mind and eyes to the perspectives of
            your fellow Konians. Maybe you are politically active and have strong opinions on a topic, that’s great! Come and share your
            opinions and views in a controlled, peaceful environment where your voice can be heard, and maybe you’ll learn a new thing or
            two.
