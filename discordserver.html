        <h1><b>Kingdom of Nerds: The Server</b></h1>
        <p>
            KoN didn't start off as a movement of weirdos, it started off as just your regular old discord server.
            In the beginning we weren't very large at all, it was just me and a couple other people that joined the server
            and winded up staying as well. I spent many a hour advertising the place, doing partnerships, spending time on there,
            everything that a server owner should do. It wasn't till several months into the creation of the place that I realized that
            we had something unique going for us here. We had a group of people of all different beliefs, and walks of life coming together
            as one community and I realized that this was something I wanted to spread to the world. We may not be your typical server or
            movement, but we hope to bring the love and sense of community we found online to the rest of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            We've got a lot going for us on the server, and we hope to keep it growing and to introduce new things to make it greater then ever
            so that everyone can feel safe and loved there. I'm going to now share everything we currently have on the server, the ideals that
            we hold dear, and much more!

            Hi there and welcome to BLN club, where I will be teaching you all about reading other people and understanding human emotions,
            as well as controlling the world around you. Now I highly recommend dropping by MSH(Meditation and Self-healing) club at some 
            point, because a big portion of understanding others emotions is to have a grasp of your own emotions first. I welcome you all,
            to BLN.
